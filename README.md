# Cleaner
Clears temporary files, DNS cache and more

### Notice
At present it only clears all temporary "files" (not folders) and clears DNS cache. In future updates I'll include more options.

## How to use
1. Save the file from the latest release
2. Right-click the file and run as admin(Windows might show you a warning but, is okay, just allow it)

3. Accept EULA.
4. Boom! Finished
5. NOTE:- if not ran as admin with right click👇

### Easter Egg . . .
Running the app for the first time creates an easter egg. Add a pull request for a hint!! 😏
